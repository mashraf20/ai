      <h3>What is Self-aware?</h3>
      <p>
	  Self-aware AI involves machines that have human-level consciousness. This form of AI is not currently in existence, but would be considered the most advanced form of artificial intelligence known to man. 

Facets of self-aware AI include the ability to not only recognize and replicate humanlike actions, 
but also to think for itself, have desires, and understand its feelings.
 Self-aware AI, in essence,is an advancement and extension of theory of mind AI. 
 Where theory of mind only focuses on the aspects of comprehension and replication of human practices, 
self-aware AI takes it a step further by implying that it can and will have self-guided thoughts and reactions.
       </p>
       <h3>What is self-aware creating machines that? </h3>
       <p>
	   While we are probably far from creating machines that are self-aware,
	   we should focus our efforts toward understanding memory, 
	   learning and the ability to base decisions on past experiences.
	   This is an important step to understand human intelligence on its own.
	   And it is crucial if we want to design or evolve machines that are more 
	   than exceptional at classifying what they see in front of them.
