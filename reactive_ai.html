      <h3>Defention</h3>
	  <p>Reactive AI is a reactive machine that sees the pieces on a chess board and reacts to them.</p>
	  <h3>what is Reactive AI</h3>
	  <p>
	  These are the oldest forms of AI systems that have extremely limited capability.
	  They emulate the human mind’s ability to respond to different kinds of stimuli.
	  These machines do not have memory-based functionality. 
	  This means such machines cannot use previously gained experiences to inform their present actions, i.e., 
	  these machines do not have the ability to “learn.” These machines could only be used for automatically responding to a limited set or combination of 
	  inputs. They cannot be used to rely on memory to improve their operations based on the same. 
	  A popular example of a reactive AI machine is IBM’s Deep Blue, a machine that beat chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997.

       <h3>
The Basic form of the AI
 </h3>
       <p>
	  the basic form of AI system this type is purely reactive and has the ability neither to form memories nor to use past experiences to inform current decisions.
	  This type of intelligence involves the computer perceiving the world directly and acting on what it sees. 
	  It doesn’t rely on an internal notion of the world.

            <li> IBM’s Beep Blue which beat Kasparov at chess</li>
            <li> Google’s Alpha Go which triumphed over human go champions</li>
