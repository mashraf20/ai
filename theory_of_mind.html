            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>
			Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states — beliefs,
			intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc. — to oneself and to others. 
			Theory of mind is necessary to understand that others have beliefs, 
			desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.
