        <h2>Limited memory AI</h2>
		<p>
		Limited memory is comprised of machine learning models that derive knowledge from previously-learned information, 
		stored data, or events. Unlike reactive machines, limited memory learns from the past by 
		observing actions or data fed to them in order to build experiential knowledge.

      <h3>What is Limited memory contain?</h3>
      <p>
	  contains machines and adds its preprogrammed representations of the world which also include lane markings,
	  traffic lights and other important elements, 
	  like curves in the road. Theyâ€™re included when the car decides when to change lanes,
	  to avoid cutting off another driver or being hit by a nearby car.
       </p>
       <h3>Examples: </h3>
          <ul id="list">
            <li>Self-driving Vehicles</li>
            <li>personal digital assistants</li>
            <li>Chatbots</li>
			 </ul>
			<h3>what is limited memory depends on</h3>
			<p>
			AI that works off the principle of limited memory depends on both <br>
			pre-programmed knowledge and observations carried out over time.<br/> <br>In the case of the latter insight, 
			the AI looks at certain things within an environment and detects how they change, then makes necessary adjustments.<br/> 
			This kind of technology is already used in some autonomous cars.
			They observe how other vehicles are moving around them, in the present, and as time passes. That ongoing, 
			collected data gets added to the static data within the AI machine, such as lane markers and traffic lights. 
			Because of this improvement, we may soon see autonomous cars,
			and other applications of limited memory AI, that work faster than ever.
